I'm just a dude that likes TTRPGs, coding, and teaching how to code! I work at a big tech company during the day, but by night, I'm a father, husband, and then find time to blog/write code related to TTRPGs. Pathfinder 2e is my favorite system currently and is the target ruleset for my character sheet app, Rules Lawyer.
